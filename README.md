# Character Optimization with Genetic Algorithms

In this project, we developed a genetic algorithm capable of determining the optimal attribute conditions for a game character. In this game, two characters face each other in each battle, and they have the following attributes:

  - Attack (Atk) - Increases the normal damage dealt by a character;
  
  Defense (Def) - Decreases the normal damage received by a character;
  
  Health Points (HP) - Increases the amount of damage a character can take before death;
  
  Regeneration (Regen) - Increases the amoult of health points regained by the character;
  
  Speed (Spd) - Determines who goes first in a battle;
  
  Inteligence (Intel) - Increases the chance of the character doing a special attack;
  
  Special Attack (SpAtk) - Increases the special damage dealt by a character;
  
  Special Defense (SpDef) - Decreases the special damage received by a character;
  
  Luck - Increases the chance of the character dealing a critical hit;
  
  Agility (Agi) - Increases the chance of the character to dodge an attack.
